# Laravel Backend Implementation for Dynamic Subdomain Routing

**Multi-tenant SaaS architecture for school management API with subdomain-based tenant isolation (e.g., brightacademy.edusphere.com, sunnyschool.edusphere.com).**

**Key Concepts:**

- **Tenant Detection Middleware**: Extracts and identifies the tenant from the subdomain.
- **School Model**: Manages tenants with unique subdomains, names, and statuses.
- **Database Migration**: Creates the schools table and adds tenant foreign keys.
- **Route Configuration**: Handles subdomain-based routing with tenant middleware.
- **Tenant-Aware Base Controller**: Automatically scopes database queries to the current tenant.
- **School Registration Controller**: Handles new school registration and subdomain assignment.

**Architecture Overview:**

- **Tenant Isolation**: Each school's data is completely separated.
- **Automatic Scoping**: All queries are automatically scoped to the current tenant.
- **Scalable Registration**: New schools can register and get instant subdomains.
- **Security**: Built-in protection against cross-tenant data access.
- **Branded Experience**: Each school gets its own subdomain identity.
- **Easy Migration**: Existing single-tenant code easily converts to multi-tenant.

**Implementation Checklist:**

- Create School model and migration
- Add TenantMiddleware and register it
- Update existing models with school_id foreign keys
- Modify all controllers to use tenant scoping
- Update routes with subdomain constraints
- Create SchoolController for registration
- Set up local development with hosts file
- Test tenant isolation and subdomain routing
- Deploy with wildcard DNS configuration

**Technical Considerations:**

- Database Performance: Index school_id fields for optimal query performance
- Caching Strategy: Implement tenant-aware caching to prevent data leaks
- Session Management: Configure sessions to work across subdomains
- File Storage: Organize uploaded files by tenant for isolation
- Background Jobs: Ensure queue jobs respect tenant context
- Logging: Include tenant information in application logs
- Monitoring: Track performance and usage per tenant
- Backup Strategy: Consider tenant-specific backup and restore capabilities
